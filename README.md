### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karl and I am currently a Computer Science undergrad who is looking to specialize in Computer Science theory, functional programming and type theory, and systems programming. I'm currently building a monolithic kernel (not as big and professional as Linux) using the C programming language, and hopefully, port Haskell into it.

I'm not a functional programming expert, yet, but I'm hoping to be one, someday.
