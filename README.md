### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karl and I am currently a Computer Science undergrad who is looking to specialize in Computer Science theory, functional programming and type theory, and systems programming.

I'm not a functional programming expert, yet, but I'm hoping to be one, someday. I mostly use Haskell and trying to get into Agda for theorem proving.
